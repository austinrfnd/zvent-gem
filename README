== Description

This call returns an event object.
	event = @zvent.find_event('12345')

Each event has a venue object
	venue = event.venue

To search for events give it a location
	events = @zvent.find_events('Simi Valley, CA')
	events[:event_count] 		#how many events total are in this search
	events[:events] 				#access to the array of events

- Get a list of categories
- Implement tzinfo timezones of events
- Have it not blow up if event can not be found with find_event call
- Error messages for zvents API error
