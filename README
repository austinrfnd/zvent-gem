== Description

An interface with zvents API without all the mess.

== Usage

give it your API key when you initialize the session object.
	@zvent = Zvent::Sesion.new('API_KEY')

To get an event you give it an event id.
This call returns an event object.
	event = @zvent.find_event('12345')
	
The event can get images of all different types and sizes
	event.image('tiny')			# returns an image (44x44)

The event can have categories of sorts
	event.categories				# returns the category object

The event has support for timezones.  Please read the rdoc for more examples
	event.startTime					# Returns the UTC of the start time
	event.endTime(false)    # Returns the end time of the event in local time to the venue.  
													# If the venue is in US/Pacific the time of the event will come back
													# in US/Pacific.

Each event has a venue object
	venue = event.venue 		# returns the venue object

To search for events give it a location
	events = @zvent.find_events('Simi Valley, CA')
	events[:event_count] 		# how many events total are in this search
	events[:events] 			# access to the array of events

== TODO

- Ensure the classes don't blow up when you start asking for specific things
