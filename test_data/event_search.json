The two-hour event will move to the new NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE, a world-class 7,100-seat venue located across the street from STAPLES Center in downtown Los Angeles. The 2008 ESPYs presented by HUMMER will be televised July 20 at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN/ESPN HD with additional unique content available on a variety of ESPN multimedia platforms including ESPN.com and ESPN International.\r\n\r\n“I’m very excited to be hosting the 16th edition of The ESPYs. I can’t wait for the day of the show as I’m truly a sports junkie,” said Timberlake. “Since the last ESPYs, there have been amazing moments in sports and I’m looking forward to recapping all of them with ESPN’s diehard fans.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to his multi-platinum album FutureSex/LoveSounds, which had four consecutive #1 singles, his 2007 FutureSex/LoveShow tour, and multiple GRAMMY Awards and an Emmy, Justin Timberlake has appeared in several films including Shrek the Third, Black Snake Moan, Alpha Dog and Southland Tales. This summer Timberlake can be seen in The Love Guru, co-starring Mike Myers and Jessica Alba.\r\n\r\nMaura Mandt, executive producer of The 2008 ESPYs said, “I'm beyond excited to have Justin as this year’s host. Not only is he a world-class music performer and established actor but he is a talented and creative producer. He brings his talent and enthusiasm for sports to the show. And this year, with Justin and a new home at NOKIA Theatre L.A. Live, The ESPYs will rise to a new level.\"\r\n\r\nESPN has signed a multi-year deal with NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE to serve as the home of The ESPYs. The show had been held at the Kodak Theatre for the past six years.\r\n\r\n“We are thrilled that ESPN has chosen NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE as the new home of The ESPYs,” said Tim Leiweke, President & CEO, AEG, owners of NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE. “As the industry’s new location for the best concerts, special events and awards shows, we are proud that The ESPYs, clearly the preeminent awards show combining sports and entertainment, will stay in Los Angeles and at NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE for years to come. “\r\n\r\nThe ESPYs\r\n\r\nThe ESPYs gather top celebrities from sports and entertainment to commemorate the past year in sports by recognizing major sports achievements, reliving unforgettable moments and saluting the leading performers and performances. The 2008 ESPYs will include both sport-specific awards such as Best MLB Player and Best WNBA Player and distinguishing “Best in Sport” awards, categories that pit different sports against each other, such as Best Team or Best Female Athlete. The ESPYs are committed to the advancement of The V Foundation for Cancer Research, established by ESPN with the late Jim Valvano and announced at the inaugural ESPYs in 1993.\r\n\r\nFor the fifth consecutive year, fans will determine the winners in all categories (except the Arthur Ashe Courage Award and other special awards) by voting online at www.espys.tv starting Tuesday, July 1.\r\n\r\nNOKIA Theatre L.A.

Like similar teen pop favorites -- who have included the Backstreet Boys, C-Note, Christina Aguilera, Hanson, the Spice Girls, and Britney Spears -- Timberlake usually doesn't get much respect from rock critics (who, in many cases, tend to be very alternative-minded and anti-commercialistic). Regardless, he is adored by millions of fans, many of whom have been adolescent girls. Over the years, the teen market has had a lot of different sounds. In the '70s, for example, artists like Donny Osmond, the Partridge Family, David Cassidy, and the DeFranco Family were aimed at teens -- those were the bubblegum popsters one typically read about in Tiger Beat magazine back then. But Timberlake is part of the more modern school of teen pop, which is mindful of dance-pop, urban contemporary, and hip-hop and got started with the rise of New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany in the late '80s. New Kids, in fact, were the male group that paved the way for *NSYNC as well as the Backstreet Boys and Take That (who were meant to be a British equivalent of New Kids). And just as Tiger Beat (the bible of bubblegum) was obsessed with the New Kids in the late '80s, it would become equally obsessed with *NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys in the '90s.Like Spears (who Timberlake became romantically involved with), Aguilera, and *NSYNC's JC Chasez, Timberlake got his start on the Disney Channel's '90s version of The Mickey Mouse Club. Timberlake and Chasez were on The Mickey Mouse Club simultaneously in their pre-*NSYNC days, and they kept working together when *NSYNC was formed. *NSYNC got started in Orlando, FL, in 1996, when Timberlake and Chasez teamed up with Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Joey Fatone. Released by RCA/BMG in 1998, the vocal quintet's self-titled debut album sold millions of copies in both the United States and Europe and contained the smash hits \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearing Up My Heart.\" *NSYNC's second album, No Strings Attached, was released on Jive in 2000 and was even more commercially successful; No Strings Attached went double platinum in only one week, and the singles \"Bye Bye Bye\" and \"This I Promise You\" became major hits.Jive released Celebrity, *NSYNC's third album, in 2001, and after that, Timberlake started recording as a solo artist. The singer had performed live as a solo artist before *NSYNC, but it wasn't until the early 2000s that he actually recorded an album as a solo act. Justified, Timberlake's first solo album, was released on Jive in November 2002. \"Like I Love You,\" the album's first single, became a major hit and was followed by a second single, \"Cry Me a River\" (not to be confused with the melancholy Arthur Hamilton standard that was a hit for the late jazz singer/actress Julie London in 1955). Now a bona fide star -- the album had reached number two on the Billboard 200 -- and heartthrob to millions of girls, Timberlake continued his success by appearing on the Black Eyed Peas smash hit \"Where Is the Love?\" and in the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII, where he pulled off part of co-performer Janet Jackson's top in the now infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" incident. That event, however, didn't stop him from winning two Grammys that year, and though he stayed out of the studio for a few years in order to concentrate on acting opportunities, Timberlake returned to the music world in 2006 with his Prince-inspired FutureSex/LoveSounds, which featured production work from Timbaland and Rick Rubin, and was followed by a brief club tour. ~ Alex Henderson, All Music Guide","url":"http://www.justintimberlake.com/","zurl":"/performers/show/1086-justin-timberlake","images":[{"url":"http://www.zvents.com/images/internal/6/1/3/7/img_7316_thumb.jpg?resample_method=cropped","width":337,"height":400}]}]},{"endTime":"","id":82509754,"name":"The Soundtrack of Your Summer Tour featuring: Boys Like Girls and Good Charlotte with Metro Station and The Maine","phone":"(213) 388-1400","price":"$28.50","private":false,"startTime":"Sat Jul 19 19:30:00 GMT 2008","url":"http://www.livenation.com/event/getEvent/eventId/327394","zurl":"/los-angeles-ca/events/show/82509754-the-soundtrack-of-your-summer-tour-featuring-boys-like-girls-and-good-charlotte-with-metro-station-and-the-maine","color":"","sc":0,"vid":9905,"description":"The East Coast post-grunge/pop-punk outfit Good Charlotte was founded in 1996 by identical brothers Joel and Benji Madden.

After Boys Like Girls posted some early demos online, the band's catchy hooks and youthful enthusiasm had gathered them quite a following by 2005's end, while also catching the attention of industry players like booking agent Matt Galle (My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday) and producer Matt Squire (Panic! at the Disco, Northstar), who both contacted the band about working together. Following a national /PureVolume-sponsored tour with Hit the Lights and A Thorn for Every Heart, Boys Like Girls entered the studio with Squire to record their debut album.

As is often the case in the band's native Hollywood, Metro Station owes its formation to a handful of well-placed connections. Co-frontman Cyrus is the stepson of country star Billy Ray Cyrus, and his half sister, Miley Cyrus, plays the title character on Disney's Hannah Montana. Similarly, Musso's younger brother plays the role of Oliver Oken in Hannah Montana, and the two older-sibling musicians met at the urging of their respective mothers. After adding keyboardist Healy to the lineup, the trio recorded a single -- the teenage anthem \"Seventeen Forever\" -- and were surprised by its sudden chart success at /MySpace.com. The group's Internet presence attracted the attention of percussionist Improgo, who took note of the band's mix of '80s-styled electro and pop. Improgo soon joined Metro Station as the band's drummer, and the group set off to play shows in the L.A. area. However, it was /MySpace that would (again) prove to be their biggest asset, as an intern at Red Ink discovered the band while perusing the website's music listings. A record deal with Red Ink followed in late 2006 -- the very same year as Metro Station's formation -- and the quartet headed to New York City to record its first full-length album.

It's when you experience something so fully you don't think about it or analyze it, you just enjoy it. The moment is that magical place where you scream the loudest, laugh the hardest and live the fullest.\r\n\r\nAs a one-of-a-kind entertainment campus, the vision of L.A. LIVE is to provide Los Angeles' residents, commuters, guests and tourists a genuine world-class sports and entertainment destination where they can experience moments like this all the time.\r\n\r\nLocated in the center of the entertainment capital of the world, the 5.6 million square foot L.A. LIVE mixed-used development on 27 acres will be the primary \"content campus\" and event center for Southern California where people seeking entertainment offerings intersect with the sports and entertainment industries at work in an energetic, unique, urban environment covering more than 6 city blocks.\r\nLeveraging the tremendous success of STAPLES Center, L.A. LIVE will expand the entertainment content in downtown Los Angeles' South Park neighborhood with complimenting venues, fully functioning broadcast studios, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, bowling lanes, music clubs and cultural museum.\r\n\r\nIn addition, L.A. LIVE will serve as the catalyst to enhance the economic potential of the adjacent Los Angeles Convention Center by adding a convention headquarters hotel and meeting space, making Los Angeles competitive with other regional convention markets. As a major mechanism in rejuvenating the downtown core, L.A. LIVE will also invigorate an emerging high-density urban residential neighborhood and pedestrian district.\r\n\r\nL.A. LIVE is a one-of-a-kind, landmark entertainment destination. It is a multi-faceted campus featuring an exciting mix of entertainment from sports to music to movies to dining. It will serve as the leading entertainment destination for all of Los Angeles and as the event capital of the world. L.A. LIVE was created to put its audiences in the moment. \"Live\" is the driving force - you cannot get any more \"live\" than when you are in the moment.","images":["http://www.zvents.com/images/internal/img_125231.jpg"],"types":["Auditorium"]},{"address":"3790 Wilshire Boulevard","id":9905,"parent_id":null,"name":"The Wiltern","phone":"(213) 388-1400","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","zip":"90005","latitude":34.0617,"longitude":-118.309,"state":"CA","timezone":"US/Pacific","url":"http://www.livenation.com/venue/getVenue/venueId/1237","zurl":"/los-angeles-ca/venues/show/9905-the-wiltern","private":false,"description":"The WILTERN THEATRE first opened its doors to movie crowds on October 7th, 1931 as the WARNER THEATRE, a part of the Warner Brothers chain of first-run theaters. It was later opened under the banners of several different theater chains, and was re-named THE WILTERN - after its location at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue in the Mid-City neighborhood of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nRecognized by the City of Los Angeles as a Historic Cultural Monument and placed on the National Register of Historic Places, this Art Deco Landmark was saved from the wrecking ball by the concerted efforts of the fledgling Los Angeles Conservancy and was renovated and restored to its original splendor in 1985 by the Ratkovich Company, opening under the direction of Bill Graham Presents with performances by the ALVIN AILEY DANCE THEATER.\r\n\r\nFollowing a legendary history of performances and events, a $1.5 million facelift led to the Grand Re-Opening on October 15, 2002. Formerly an all-seated venue, the theatre had its 1,200-orchestra level seats removed and now features a five-tiered floor that rises upward from the stage, thereby accommodating every type of audience, from a standing-room-only configuration to banquet-style seated events. The balcony still offers a thousand permanent seats, and the flexible new arrangement allows for seats to be brought in to the floor section downstairs for more intimate performances. The venue's new capacity is roughly 2,300, depending on how the main floor level is arranged. In October 2003, The Wiltern and LG Electronics, a leading global consumer electronics company, celebrated the renaming of the theater. Currently known as The Wiltern LG, this venue sponsorship will offer concert-goers the opportunity to become acquainted with LG Electronics' line of well-designed, groundbreaking digital products. Formerly a great place to catch more sedate acts, the Wiltern's new design makes it one of “LA's coolest venues to check out performers of any type of music” says AOL’s City Guide.
